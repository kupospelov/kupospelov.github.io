<h1>My unoriginal approach to manage dotfiles</h1>
<p>After I had to set up a few machines this year, I finally realized that I should have a tool to version and quickly restore my configuration files. This post is about what I came up with.</p>
<p>My <code>$HOME</code> is a git repository similar to one described in the <a href=https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html>post</a> by Drew DeVault. I like this approach, because there is no need in symlinks and git is a nice and familiar tool to use. My setup is a little bit different though.</p>
<p>In fact, my <code>$HOME</code> contains two git repositories: one for general-purpose public dotfiles and one for private dotfiles. I do this by specifying <code>--git-dir</code> and <code>--work-tree</code>, inspired by <a href=https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles>this article</a>. For convenience, I created two different shell aliases for these commands.</p>
<p>The general-purpose part defines the file structure and can be shared in a public <a href=https://git.sr.ht/~kupospelov/dotfiles>repository</a>. This is the place to store the files for <em>all</em> my machines. This is also almost everything that I need on my personal ones.</p>
<p>The private part contains files that are specific to the organization I am working at, and that is the reason to store them in a separate internal repository. This repository can generally have more than one branch to store files for different machine types.</p>
<p>I find storing machine-specific configuration in git a bit cumbersome, so parameters like output scale or touchpad sensitivity are not versioned. My dotfiles contain so few such files that I do not care if I have to recreate them manually at some point.</p>
<p>The tricky thing is to refactor the configuration files to split them into public and private ones. There is no one-fits-all solution to this problem. Ideally, you would want to use <code>config.d</code> directories to store the pieces that are different, but this may not always be possible. In <code>.bashrc</code>, I use a simple <code>for</code> loop which iterates over all files in <code>~/.bashrc.d</code> and sources them. In the case of sway, the <code>include</code> command makes it possible to put some pieces of the configuration outside of the main config file.</p>
<p>In the end, restoring a complete configuration in this setup boils down to cloning the global dotfiles and the proper private branch, and then to optional per-device customizations.</p>
