The command literally binds actions to keysyms, which means that your shortcuts constantly change their position or may not work at all.</p><p>What makes it look even more weird is that in i3 <code>bindsym</code> <em>does</em> work consistently in any layout, because i3 simply translates the specified keysyms into keycodes. You can even specify which layout should be used for the translation using <code>Group[1-4]</code>.</p><p>The topic of input processing is far more complex than I could imagine, mostly because different people have <em>very</em> different opinions about how it should be implemented. The very idea to change the meaning of the <code>bindsym</code> command triggered a lot of back-and-forth discussion with quite a few people involved.</p><p>The process took some time, but in the end we finally got a solution that should work for everyone. With the new <code>--to-code</code> flag, the behavior of Sway&rsquo;s <code>bindsym</code> becomes roughly equivalent to that of i3. This is not as tedious as you might think, because you can specify the flag only once per block of bindings:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>bindsym --to-code {
    $mod+Return exec $term
    $mod+Shift+c reload
    # etc
}
</code></pre><p>A few points regarding the current implementation:</p><ul><li>The translation only uses the first configured layout. A change in the input configuration can trigger re-translation of the configured bindings.</li><li>In case the translation fails, the binding will work as an ordinary <code>bindsym</code>, and a warning will be logged. We cannot fail the command in this case, because <code>input</code> and <code>bindsym</code> commands can be in any order (and cannot be sorted, in case of IPC), so the relevant input configuration may not be available yet.</li><li>In case a keysym cannot be resolved into a single keycode, the translation will fail. This should not be a frequent use-case, so the complexity it introduces is not worth it at this point.</li></ul><p>The feature will appear in Sway 1.1, which is going to be released soon. You can also get an RC build and try it out now.</p></article></main><footer><hr><p>The content is licensed under <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a>.</p><br></footer></body></html>
